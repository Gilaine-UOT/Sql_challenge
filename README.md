# SQL_challenge

## Module 9

On this project I have analyzed the company employee data from the 1980s and 1990s performing data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.I created tables to store the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then responded to the company's inquiries regarding the data.


## Data Modeling

Using QuickDBD, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables to model the data used in this project as following below:
